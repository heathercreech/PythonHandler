# PythonHandler

PythonHandler is a utility that makes it easy to use Python functions in C++ applications
.

##Dependencies
The only requirement for this utility is Python's libraries, which are included in every Python installation. Currently, only Python 3.5.0+ is supported.

##Using a PythonHandler
####Purpose
Python's provided libraries for embedding it's functionality into C++ is cumbersome and requires knowledge of when to dereference Python objects. The purpose for the PythonHandler is to take the dereferencing out of the users hands, and to provide a quicker (less code) way to use Python functions.
####Initialization

##Using a FunctionManager
*Note: the FunctionManager is a temporary interface to make handling arguments easier. A more permanent solution will be developed later.
